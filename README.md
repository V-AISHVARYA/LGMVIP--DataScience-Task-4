**IMAGE TO PENCIL SKETCH WITH PYTHON**


**PROJECT OVERVIEW**  
This repository contains a Python project that focuses on converting RGB images into pencil sketches. The idea behind this project is to provide a simple and intuitive tool that can transform regular images into artistic pencil sketches.
This project serves to work using divide function from cv2 Library in Python.


**STEPS INVOLVED:**  
Image Loading: The RGB image is loaded using a popular image processing library.  
Grayscale Conversion: The RGB image is converted into grayscale to simplify the processing.  
Inversion: The grayscale image is inverted to simulate the appearance of a pencil sketch.  
Blur: A Gaussian blur is applied to the inverted grayscale image to achieve a smoother, more artistic look.  
Blend: The blurred inverted grayscale image is blended with the original grayscale image to introduce pencil-like textures.  
Pencil Sketch:The blende image is the pencil sketch generated,artistically interpreting the original image.  


PREREQISITES:
>python latest version installed  
>vs code(with python extension installed) or any IDE (should support cv2 library)  
>Opencv Library installed in your python environment  
To Install:pip install opencv-python



**REFLECTION**  
I have gained insights into fundamental image processing concepts like color inversion, grayscale conversion, blurring, and blending.Developing the converter involves writing Python code to load images, process pixels, apply filters, and save output. This project has significantly improved my Python programming skills, including handling file input/output, working with libraries, and scripting.
